                It is said that the pinnacle of human achievement was the creation of the Alexandra Library. It's loss meant
                that progress and accumulation of knowledge experienced a major setback that brought about the dark ages.
                One could say that it is thanks to the inheritance of written records from our ancestors that have helped 
                bring about the modern comforts and convinience we so take for granted in this day and age.

                To that end, we have created GetBooks as a way to easily ferry these harbingers of knowledge to your doorstep.
                Set up back in 1950, we have prioritized the quality of our catalogue in the hopes of igniting the spark of
                curiosity and fan the flames of imagination stored within the crucible of our unfathomable minds. From humble
                roots in Essex, we have expanded our reach globally in order to achieve our vision of a world connected
                by the wisdom locked in books.
            </p>
            <p>
                From wonderous fiction written by prestigious and intelligent authors like Terry Prachett and Brian Jacques,
                to informative and expansive biographies and non-fiction bestsellers, GetBooks is here to sate your mental hunger.
